## Aquaopoly

Welcome to Aquaopoly!
This was a Capstone project for Fall 2022 at the Missouri University of Science and Technology, 
worked on by myself and my team of five.
The goal of the project was to produce a Monopoly video game with a thematic twist!
We chose to use the Godot Game Engine, version 3, and has not been updated to Godot version 4.

Our theme was water, thus Aqua-opoly. We created a fully 3D environment with physics based 
dice and the other simple game systems that are commonly found in the regular Monopoly game.

The game executable can be found in in the Aquaopoly.zip file within this repository.
